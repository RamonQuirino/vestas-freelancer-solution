Backend developed in dotnet core, with entity framework in codeFirst mode. using a memory database.

Frontend developed with angular 8,

Both projects are subject to many improvements,
the frontend part could be separated into more modules and better defined components,

Both projects should be tested,

as possible changes, editing of entries and filters by projects could be included.

Thanks.
